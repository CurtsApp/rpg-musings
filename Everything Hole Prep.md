## The Everything Hole

A big trash pit where Basion dumps it's trash

## Locations (After Entering the hole roll on this table)

1. The Cathedral of Used Diaper
2. Aero-Turbineers Graveyard
3. Whole houses, crumbling into each others, partially
destroyed, from a time when it was cheaper to throw
one's home in the trash and buy a new one than moving
out.
4. Hundreds of thousands of bird skeletons.
5. Carcass of an alien ship. Looks more like a drill rig than
a flying saucer. Only the frame and an elephant-sized
chair in the cockpit remain inside.
6. (At least 3 happen first) Pr. Davies' legacy

### The Cathedral of Used Diaper

This forsaken sanctuary emerges as an eerie testament to a bygone era, a haunting symbol of human excess and the decay of civilization.Approaching the site, one is immediately struck by its grotesque grandeur. 

The exterior walls are fashioned from discarded metal scraps and worn-out plastics. Layers upon layers of rust and grime obscure any remnants of their former colors, giving a somber and monolithic appearance. Tattered banner ads and remnants of a huggies and pamper's boxes hang limp in the polluted wind, their vibrant hues faded to melancholic shades of gray.

Stepping through the entrance, one is confronted by an assault on the senses. The air is thick with the stench of decay and waste, a sickening blend of decomposing matter and chemical residues. 

A group resides here that has jerry-rigged a way to create electricity using the decomposing feces. They use this power to dimly light bulbs under which they plot revenge on CSGD which allowed them to be marked as trash.



### Aero-Turbineer's Graveyard

Damaged or Discarded Aircraft Parts: Scattered around the graveyard, you may find various pieces of aircraft parts. These could include partially melted engines, wings, fuselages, landing gears, control surfaces, and other components that were removed or replaced during maintenance or salvaging efforts. Some of these parts may be intact, while others might be heavily damaged or deteriorated.

Abandoned Maintenance Equipment: As the Aero-Turbineer aircraft were decommissioned or left to deteriorate, the graveyard may contain remnants of maintenance equipment that were once used to service these aircraft. These could include toolboxes, repair manuals, inspection equipment, and other items left behind by maintenance crews.

- Wrenches
- Radio Diagnostic Device: Detects radio signals
- Airship Balancing Scales: Used primarily for airship-like aircraft, these large-scale balancing scales help determine and distribute weight evenly across the aircraft. 
- Welding Torches (Needs plugged in)
- Telescopic Steam-Powered Lifts: These mechanical lifts are used for accessing hard-to-reach areas of the aircraft during maintenance or repairs. They feature extendable telescopic arms driven by steam-powered hydraulics, allowing mechanics to elevate themselves to the desired height for improved access and maneuverability.
- Pinkerton Lubrication Oils

Historical Significance: The Aero-Turbineers Graveyard could hold historical significance as a testament to the evolution of aviation technology. It might be a place where aviation enthusiasts, historians, or engineers visit to study the progress made in aircraft design and safety. People interested in the history of the Aero-Turbineer models or the development of aviation safety standards may find the graveyard an intriguing place to explore.

#### Professor Archibald Cogswell

An exiled aviation historian and an expertise in the intricacies of steam-powered flight, Professor Cogswell tirelessly unravels the mysteries of these fantastical flying machines with hopes of reaching the stars. Known for his extensive knowledge, meticulous research, and insightful analysis, he is not respected within the academic community after it was discovered he was a mockery. If the characters validate the utility of his work 

- Mentions paths of discolored *graying* skin
- Tell the characters about his research will culminates to his construction of perfectly accurate model airplane launcher. He just needs a dense enough power source to run it.
- If given a power core (from alien ship) he will give the party a launcher and their choice of 3
